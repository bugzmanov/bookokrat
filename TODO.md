ideas to implement:
 - make margins configurable + text color 
 - table of contents of a book
 - images in ghosty terminal
 - Recent books
     - drop dates from book reads. and instead make a separate list of most recent read books
 - AI integreration
 - Mouse support: 
   - scroll
   - select text
 - logs/debug window
 - NOTES & comments
 - settings window
 - integration with GUI book reader 
 - integration with GOODREADS
 - Code formatting & coloring. Goal: Manning books should be nice to read
 - ASCII art animation
 - reading history


bugz: 
ctrl+o - for opening is a bad idea, since this is usually "go back" in vim
